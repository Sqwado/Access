1
00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.230
<v Speaker1>What if I told you that you can have your
cake and eat it too?

2
00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:16.660
<v Speaker1>What if I told you that you can build a
small PC?

3
00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.060
<v Speaker1>That is powerful, but also quiet?

4
00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:20.410
<v Speaker1>This is the answer.

5
00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:26.440
<v Speaker1>The damn case a4, H2O, which I firmly
believe is the best case for most people.

6
00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.670
<v Speaker1>As the name implies, this case is heavily
focused on water cooling, giving you a

7
00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.430
<v Speaker1>dedicated space for a radiator and fans at
the top.

8
00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.320
<v Speaker1>It has the sharp, minimalist design with no
branding other than a tasteful plaque on the

9
00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.330
<v Speaker1>back, no logos or lights, no glass side
panels or excessive plastic.

10
00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.520
<v Speaker1>Just a nice metal box.

11
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.480
<v Speaker1>I love the circular cutouts on the panels
and the two large rubber feet, which most

12
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.640
<v Speaker1>importantly, don't mark your desk.

13
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.350
<v Speaker1>The internal structure is steel, meaning
that it doesn't flex easily, and the panels

14
00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.140
<v Speaker1>are aluminium, which helps keep the overall
weight down.

15
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:06.450
<v Speaker1>At only 11l, it's smaller than most cases
out there, whilst not being so small that you

16
00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.870
<v Speaker1>need to start making serious compromises
with your component choices.

17
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.980
<v Speaker1>It supports three slot graphics cards up to
322mm long, so even 4090 should be fine, and

18
00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.250
<v Speaker1>you even get a cutout at the front of the
case to feed it through for easy

19
00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.110
<v Speaker1>installation, which is a very thoughtful
touch.

20
00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.170
<v Speaker1>When choosing a water cooler.

21
00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.080
<v Speaker1>For this case, don't just pick the one that
looks the best.

22
00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.770
<v Speaker1>If the tubes are too long, you're going to
have a very hard time fitting it in.

23
00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:39.940
<v Speaker1>I'm using an EC basic AIO 240 mil, which has
a tube length of 350mm and that fits quite

24
00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.030
<v Speaker1>snugly, so make sure to check your tube
length before you buy.

25
00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.500
<v Speaker1>Make sure you also pick up two fan grilles,
otherwise your hoses will stick inside your

26
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.480
<v Speaker1>fan blades, preventing them from spinning.

27
00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:54.700
<v Speaker1>It supports both SFX and sfx l power
supplies, but I really recommend sticking

28
00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.640
<v Speaker1>with the standard SFX so you have more room
for your cables.

29
00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.690
<v Speaker1>You may even wish to invest in custom cables
if the cables that came with your power

30
00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:06.310
<v Speaker1>supply, like mine with this EVGA unit,
aren't very flexible, which can make things a

31
00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:07.600
<v Speaker1>whole lot more challenging.

32
00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.920
<v Speaker1>If you haven't bought your power supply yet,
consider the Corsair SFF 750.

33
00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.850
<v Speaker1>As the cables it comes with are braided and
flexible, and that'll save you some headache.

34
00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.130
<v Speaker1>The case officially supports a 2.5in drive
mounted on the removable bottom tray, but

35
00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.680
<v Speaker1>with all the cables, this is going to get
crowded very fast.

36
00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.270
<v Speaker1>Just stick to an NVMe drive as there are no
intake fans on the motherboard side of your

37
00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:33.010
<v Speaker1>case, your NVMe will likely get very hot, so
get a heatsink if your motherboard doesn't

38
00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.330
<v Speaker1>come with one built in.

39
00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.610
<v Speaker1>Start with your water cooler and mount it to
the bracket.

40
00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.880
<v Speaker1>Then drop it through the top of the case and
screw it down.

41
00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.080
<v Speaker1>Remember to orient your fans as exhaust,
pulling air through the case and out the top.

42
00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.880
<v Speaker1>Assemble your motherboard outside the case
and attach the motherboard side of your PSU

43
00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.950
<v Speaker1>cables before screwing it down.

44
00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.970
<v Speaker1>Attach your cables to your power supply,
then mount it inside the case with the fan

45
00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.260
<v Speaker1>facing outward.

46
00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.290
<v Speaker1>Install your motherboard headers and tidy up
those cables.

47
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.600
<v Speaker1>I personally found routing the CPU power
cable on the bottom and to the left of the I

48
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.670
<v Speaker1>o shield to be very helpful.

49
00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.470
<v Speaker1>If you have any loose cabling, you can try
utilizing empty space like behind the fans or

50
00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:31.760
<v Speaker1>above the power supply.

51
00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.300
<v Speaker1>Finally install your graphics card.

52
00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.190
<v Speaker1>Watch out for the small clip.

53
00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.130
<v Speaker1>I've seen a few instances online where
people have broken theirs off.

54
00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.460
<v Speaker1>You should be left with a very dense but
clean looking system.

55
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.940
<v Speaker1>The only thing I don't really like about
this case is this power cable that sits above

56
00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.020
<v Speaker1>the graphics card.

57
00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.710
<v Speaker1>I would have loved to have seen a hidden
channel inside the radiator compartment to

58
00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:55.720
<v Speaker1>keep that hidden, but it's not a big deal.
